# Keychain-Conundrum
Problem Statement:
Four friends—Alice, Bob, Claire, and David—have a collection of keychains. Each friend has a different number of keychains. Here are the clues they provide:

Alice has more keychains than Claire but fewer than David.
Bob has an odd number of keychains.
Claire has more keychains than Bob.
David has the fewest keychains.
Determine the number of keychains each friend has.

Solution:

Clue 4 states that David has the fewest keychains, so let's assign him the smallest possible number, which is 1.
According to clue 2, Bob has an odd number of keychains. Since 1 is already assigned to David, Bob must have a higher odd number. Let's assign him 3.
Clue 1 states that Alice has more keychains than Claire but fewer than David. Since David has 1 keychain and Bob has 3, Alice must have 2 keychains.
Finally, clue 3 indicates that Claire has more keychains than Bob. With Bob having 3 keychains, Claire must have more than 3. Let's assign her 4.
The number of keychains for each friend is as follows:
Alice: 2
Bob: 3
Claire: 4
David: 1
